# Precalc
This repo contains some code which can graph equations in a UIView.

Summary:
---

Basically, you define an equation, tell the graph what color to draw in, and CoreGraphics does the rest.

I've been meaning to make something like this during precalculus and then during calculus 1, so before I take calc 2, I'm finally making this thing.

The playground is documented fairly well, so have a look.

Technical:
---

Written during bus and subway commutes using Xcode 7.3.1 and Swift 2.2.

TODO:
---

- [] Implement more trig functions
- [] Implement parabolas
- [] Investigate and implement calculus stuff, such as shading and representations of estimation methods. 
- [] Implement transformation functions
